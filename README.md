# cambium

The knowledge-lifecycle MCP that turns work your agents already did into
**compound, org-wide knowledge**. cambium bridges two substrates that already
exist — [agentsync](https://github.com/jarmstrong158/agentsync) (what happened:
claims, finishes, notes, changed files) and
[context-keeper](https://github.com/jarmstrong158/context-keeper) (why: decisions,
constraints) — and adds the three things neither has:

1. **`distill()`** — turn events into memory *automatically* (passive capture)
2. **`recall()`** — one federated read endpoint for **every agent type**
   (coding agent, Slack KB bot, SRE bot — same store, same call)
3. **`promote()`** — graduate knowledge **local → team → org** as it earns trust

Named for the cambium layer of a tree: the thin living tissue where all growth
happens.

## Why a third MCP (and not a database)

Knowledge layers fail because they're a *side system* nobody calls. cambium's
bet: capture and recall must be **native tools in the agent's loop**, and state
must live in the **substrate the work already lives in** — git — not a separate
service. Storage is an implementation detail behind `recall()`:

| Scope | Lives in | Trust gate |
|---|---|---|
| `local` | `<repo>/.cambium/knowledge.json` | none — it's yours |
| `team`  | `knowledge.json` on a dedicated `cambium` branch of the shared repo | recalls ≥ N **or** an endorsement |
| `org`   | `knowledge.json` in a dedicated org knowledge repo | an **endorsement required**; optionally lands as a **pull request** — review is the gate, `git revert` is the undo |

Team writes use the agentsync pattern: a private worktree under `.git/` and
`git push` as compare-and-swap, so concurrent agents never clobber each other.

## Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt      # just `mcp`
```

`gh` (GitHub CLI) is only needed for pull-request-mode org promotion.

## Configure

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cambium": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/abs/path/to/cambium_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "CAMBIUM_REPO": "/abs/path/to/your/project/clone",
        "CAMBIUM_AGENT_ID": "jonny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| env var | required | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAMBIUM_REPO` | yes | — | your project clone (local scope, agentsync + context-keeper substrates) |
| `CAMBIUM_AGENT_ID` | yes | — | your unique agent id |
| `CAMBIUM_REMOTE` | no | `origin` | git remote |
| `CAMBIUM_TEAM_BRANCH` | no | `cambium` | team-scope branch |
| `CAMBIUM_AGENTSYNC_BRANCH` | no | `agentsync` | where distill reads coordination events |
| `CAMBIUM_ORG_REPO` | no | — | path to the org knowledge repo clone (org scope off without it) |
| `CAMBIUM_ORG_PR` | no | direct push | `1` = org promotion opens a pull request |
| `CAMBIUM_PROMOTE_RECALLS` | no | `3` | recalls needed for local→team |
| `CAMBIUM_RELEASE_CAPTURE` | no | off | `1` = also capture agentsync claims at their done/released transition (see below) |

**Org setup**: create one (private) repo, e.g. `github.com/you/knowledge`, with
an empty `{"items": []}` in `knowledge.json`; everyone who should read org
knowledge clones it and points `CAMBIUM_ORG_REPO` at their clone. cambium
manages that clone (it hard-syncs it) — dedicate it, don't work in it.

## Tools

**`capture(content, type, kind, why, tags)`** — save a knowledge item to local
scope (types: `memory` | `need` | `skill`). Manual path.

**`record_need(content, why, tags)`** — first-class needs ("we're missing X"),
promotable like anything else so recurring wants surface at team/org level.

**`distill()`** — the automatic path. Reads agentsync's coordination branch
(every *currently done* claim: task + note + changed files → an `outcome`
memory) and context-keeper's `.context/` (active decisions & constraints,
rationale and `dec-NNN` provenance preserved). Idempotent — wire it to a
session-end or post-commit hook and capture becomes passive.

**Release-time capture (opt-in, `CAMBIUM_RELEASE_CAPTURE=1`).** agentsync keys
claims by agent id and deletes a claim from live state the instant it is
released or re-claimed — it exposes no hook or event, only the rewritten
`claims.json` on the branch. So a claim that completes and then churns before a
full distill runs against it is silently lost. With the flag on, each distill
also remembers the last-seen claim per agent and captures any that has *churned
away* since the previous run — reconstructing it from that snapshot, through the
**same** dedupe watermark, so a claim captured at release time and again in a
later full distill never double-imports. Fire `distill()` on completion events
(a post-commit / session-end hook) and completed work is captured at its
transition instead of only when a distill happens to catch it live.

What this is **not**: it is passive capture *at the moments distill runs*, not
exhaustive reconstruction. The guarantee is precise — *if a distill sweep
observes a claim while it is done (or carries a note), that knowledge is
captured even if the claim later churns.* The residual gap: a done state that is
created **and** churned away entirely between two sweeps (e.g. cambium wasn't
running) is never observed, and only agentsync's git log still holds it.
Walking that log to reconstruct such claims exhaustively is a possible
follow-up (the history survives — agentsync's `history()` reads it), deliberately
left out of this change.

**`import_memory(source, path)`** — ingest an external memory export into
cambium as local-scope, provenance-tagged knowledge items (see **Import**
below). Read-only against the source; imported items are not auto-promoted.

**`recall(query, scope, limit)`** — federated search across local+team+org.
Every hit increments the item's recall counter (the trust signal promotion
feeds on) and records cross-project use. Abstains honestly: below the relevance
floor it returns `no_confident_match: true` instead of confident-looking noise.

**`endorse(item_id, note)`** — vouch for an item. Fast-tracks local→team;
**required** for team→org.

**`promote(item_id, to_scope, force)`** — no args: scan-and-promote all
eligible local items to team. With `to_scope="org"`: push to the org repo, or
open a PR when `CAMBIUM_ORG_PR=1` (the team copy stays, annotated, until the
PR merges).

**`review_promotions()`** — what's eligible for team, what's endorsed for org,
which org PRs are pending.

**`status()`** — counts per scope/type, import watermarks, which substrates
are actually wired.

## The compound-growth loop

```
stobie's agent finishes work ──agentsync──▶ done claim + note + files
                                                 │
jonny's cambium: distill()  ◀────────────────────┘
        │ outcome memory (local)
jonny + teammates: recall() ×N  ──▶ trust grows ──▶ promote() → team
        │ visible to every collaborator's agent
someone: endorse()  ──▶ promote(to_scope="org")  ──▶ org repo / PR
        │
ANY agent, ANY project, ANY type (SRE bot, KB bot): recall(scope="org")
```

Passive capture: add a Claude Code hook that runs `distill` at session end —
capture then costs zero per-note effort. Run it on completion events too (a
post-commit hook) with `CAMBIUM_RELEASE_CAPTURE=1` and finished agentsync work
is captured at the moment it completes, before a release or re-claim can erase
it.

## Import

`import_memory(source, path)` ingests knowledge from an **external** memory
system into cambium. It is import/ingest **only** — it reads the external store
and writes cambium items; it never writes back to the source (export is a
separate, riskier feature and is deliberately out of scope). Import is modelled
as a **source adapter**, the same shape as distill's substrate readers: an
adapter reads records from a source location and yields normalized cambium
knowledge items, which land through the *same* normalize-and-write/dedupe path
distill uses — no second mechanism.

What import guarantees:

- **Local scope, always.** Imported items enter at `local` scope. They have not
  earned promotion inside cambium and are **not** auto-promoted — team/org is
  still earned the normal way, through `recall()` usage and `endorse()`.
- **Provenance, always.** Every imported item is stamped
  `source: {system, ref, imported: true, source_ts}` and tagged `imported`, so
  imported knowledge is distinguishable from natively-distilled capture and
  auditable back to its origin (system + original id + original timestamp).
- **Idempotent.** Re-importing the same records adds nothing — dedupe is by the
  source record's stable id when present, else by a content hash, routed through
  the shared watermark path.
- **Read-only against the source**, and dependency-free (stdlib, local files
  only — no network, no external auth).

### The `json` adapter (reference)

The one bundled adapter reads a **generic JSON / JSONL memory export from a
local file** — no service-specific coupling. It accepts a top-level array, an
object wrapping a list under `memories`/`items`/`records`/`data`/`entries`, or
JSONL (one JSON object per line). Each record maps as:

| cambium field | source keys (first present wins) | if absent |
|---|---|---|
| `content` (body) | `content`, `text`, `body`, `memory`, `note` | **record skipped** (no body) |
| — folded into body | `title`, `name`, `summary` | omitted |
| `why` | `why`, `reason`, `rationale`, `context` | empty |
| `kind` | `kind`, `type`, `category` | `"note"` |
| `tags` | `tags` (list or comma/space string) | just `imported`, `json` |
| `source.ref` | `id`, `uuid`, `_id`, `key` | content-hash dedupe instead |
| `source.source_ts` | `timestamp`, `created_at`, `ts`, `time`, `date` | omitted |

`type` is always `memory`; malformed lines and records with no usable body are
counted as **skipped**, never crash the import. The return value summarizes
`imported` / `skipped` / `duplicates`.

```bash
# import_memory(source="json", path="/abs/path/to/export.jsonl")
```

**Adapters are the extension point.** `json` is the only format shipped — this
is not a claim of support for any particular memory product. To ingest another
system, add one adapter (a generator yielding normalized items) to
`IMPORT_ADAPTERS`; core logic doesn't change. Adapters that require network
access or credentials are intentionally not included here.

## Test

```bash
python3 test_cambium.py
```

31 cases against real git repos: capture/recall (+ honest abstention),
distill from both substrates (exact agentsync claims format; exact
context-keeper `.context/` schema) with idempotency, **release-time capture**
(off by default; a done claim survives a re-claim churn captured exactly once;
a noted claim released before it reaches *done* is kept where a full distill
would miss it), **import** (JSON + JSONL export → provenance-tagged local items,
re-import dedupes, content-hash fallback without ids, malformed/missing fields
skipped not crashed, imported items stay local and unpromoted, source left
untouched), the full promotion lifecycle (recall-threshold, endorsement
fast-track, org-requires-endorsement, PR-mode with `gh` stubbed), cross-project
trust tracking, team-write CAS under a concurrent peer push, **two
real-agentsync integration tests** (drive the actual agentsync claim / finish /
release tools when the sibling repo is present — including the release-capture
seam), and a **real MCP stdio transport test**. CI runs it on every push.

## Limitations (honest ones)

- **Lexical recall, not semantic.** The scorer is token/substring overlap —
  deterministic and dependency-free. Swappable for embeddings later; the tool
  contract doesn't change.
- **Org usage isn't tracked** (recalls at org scope don't increment counters) —
  org items have already finished climbing.
- **PR-mode promotion isn't transactional** — the team copy stays (annotated
  with the PR URL) until a human merges. That's the point: review is the gate.
- **Distill captures at the moments it runs, not exhaustively.** By default it
  imports agentsync's *currently* done claims; a claim released or re-claimed
  before any distill catches it live is lost. `CAMBIUM_RELEASE_CAPTURE=1` closes
  most of that gap by capturing claims at their done/released transition (via a
  last-seen snapshot), but a done state created and churned away entirely
  between two sweeps is still only recoverable from agentsync's git log — a
  history walk that is not built here.
